#  My whisky

I am proud to present MyWhisky, an exciting web page exercise built with Vue.js, which I developed as part of my portfolio as a developer and as practice in using JavaScript and other technologies.

# Run and Building

If you just want to run, you can use a command which is:

```
npm  run dev
```

Then build it with the Vue tool:

```
npm run build
```
